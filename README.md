## Features I'm most proud of

#### Step 1

* **🎠 News Story Carousel 🎠**

    This feature was built using The Guardian api and a boostrap carousel set up. It took a bit of trial and error to get the imported information into the right format for the carousel to work.

* **📱 Mobile Responsiveness 📱**

    This site includes some out of the box bootstrap responsiveness as well as some extra customizations with media queries.

* **🔎 Country Zoom on the map on selection 🔍**

    This task involved setting up a semantic-ui dropdown menu and then coordinating that fuctionality with clicks from the Country table list. It took a little bit of digging to get the dropdown to update but I think the final result is well worth it.
